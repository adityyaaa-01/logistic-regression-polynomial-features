# Logistic Regression with Polynomial Features 🧠📈

This project demonstrates how to use **logistic regression with polynomial features** for classification tasks involving **non-linear decision boundaries**.

## 🚀 What I Learned
- How logistic regression works on non-linear datasets.
- Generating polynomial features to map inputs into higher dimensions.
- Plotting decision boundaries for better understanding.
- Evaluating model performance on complex feature spaces.

## 📁 Files
- `Logistic_Regression(Polynomial_input).ipynb`: Main notebook with code, plots, and explanations.

## 📊 Libraries Used
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

## 📌 Steps Performed
1. Loaded and visualized non-linear dataset.
2. Applied polynomial transformation on features.
3. Trained logistic regression model.
4. Plotted decision boundary.
5. Evaluated model accuracy.

## ✅ Output
Achieved good classification performance even with non-linear data, thanks to the polynomial transformation.
